My journey through the book "Beginning C++ through Game Programming" (Third Edition) by Michael Dawson. 
Each chapter contains the coding projects that teach the basics of C++ from data types to object oriented programming (OOP). 
I've inserted my own notes as I went through these coding examples. 

Note: The book is well worth it for anyone struggling to learn C++. 
Dawson breaks things down in an easy way to learn w/out losing the technical details. 
The book really covers the basics and is a huge help for complete beginners to C++.
